I love having a nice visualization to go along with code and analysis, so to kick off I’ll just include this incredible image of the Yukon Delta in Alaska.\n\n\n\nFalse-color image of the Yukon Delta, Alaska, USA (source)\n\n\n\nTopics\nSome major themes will be:\n\nRemote sensing\nEnvironment\nClimate\nWeather\nDemographics\nGeospatial data\n\nAs well as software and tools such as:\n\nPython\nJulia\nMachine Learning / Artificial intelligence\nCloud native data\nGeospatial software\n\n\n\nTech stack\nI’m building this website with Quarto and Pixi."
