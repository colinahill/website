## Bio

I'm a data scientist and physicist working at the intersection of remote sensing, climate, environment and machine learning.

I've worked across diverse domains ranging from stellar astrophysics to weather forecasts, from climate data to crops, GHG emissions and soil carbon sequestration. I enjoy working on challenging and impactful problems, and a consistent focus has been creating data-driven insights from sensors using physical principles combined with statistical and machine learning approaches.
